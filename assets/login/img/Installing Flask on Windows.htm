<h2>Installing Flask on Windows</h2>
<h3>November 16, 2015</h3>
</center>

<h3>1. Assuming Python (e.g., Canopy) is already installed</h3>

<p>If you have not installed it yet,
   go <a href="http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/installPython.html">here</a> and install it and come
   back to continue.</p>
  
 
<h3>2. <i>pip</i> and <i>distribute</i></h3>

<p>We'll use the Python tool <i>easy_install</i> to
  install <i>pip</i>.  To get <i>easy_install</i>, download the
  <a href="http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/distribute_setup.py">distribute_setup.py</a> by right
  clicking on it and run it by
  simply double clicking on it from your <i>Downloads</i> folder.</p>

<p>If you used Canopy to install Python, you should now be able to
  run <i>easy_install</i> in a shell (from the command prompt).
  Canopy should have added the needed information to your system's
  path information.  To check that everything is in order, open a
  command prompt and run:</p>
<pre>       easy_install
</pre>
<p>It may ask you for <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt>. If you
get an error saying "error: No urls, filenames, or requirements
specified (see --help)", then you're good to go - go to the <b>Install
PIP</b> section below.  This error is only saying you did not tell it
what to install.  If you got an error saying "'easy_install' is not
recognized. . .", then proceed to the <b>Modify Your Path</b> section.</p>


<h3>3. Modify Your Path</h3>

<p>If you got the "not recognized" error, you need to add
  the <i>easy_install</i> command and other Python scripts to the
  command search path, by adding your Python installation's Scripts
  folder to the <i>PATH</i> environment variable. To do that,
  right-click on the <b>Computer</b> icon on the <b>Desktop</b> or
  in the <b>Start</b> menu, and choose <b>Properties</b>. Then click
  on <b>Advanced System settings</b> (in Windows XP, click on
  the <b>Advanced</b> tab instead). Then click on
  the <b>Environment variables</b> button.  Finally, double-click on
  the <b>Path</b> variable in the <b>System variables</b> section,
  and add the path of your Python interpreter's Scripts folder.  Be
  sure to delimit it from existing values with a semicolon ('<b>;</b>').
  Assuming you are using Python 2.7 on the default path, add the
  following value:</p>
<pre>       ;C:\Python27\Scripts
</pre>
<p>For Canopy users, these will look like:</p>
<pre>       C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User; C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Scripts
</pre>
<p>And you are done!  To check that it worked, open the <b>Command
Prompt</b> and execute <tt>c:\easy_install</tt>.  If you
have <b>User Account Control</b> enabled on Windows Vista or
Windows 7, it should prompt you for administrator privileges.</p>


<h3>4. Install PIP</h3>

<p>Now that you have <i>easy_install</i>, you can use it to
  install <i>pip</i> with the following command on the command
  prompt.  If you are not at the <b>C:\</b> folder, you need to go
  to that folder to issue this command:</p>
<pre>       C:\easy_install pip
</pre>
<p>Now, you are ready to install Flask.</p>



<h3>5. Install Flask</h3>

<p>You should use <i>pip</i> to install and deploy <i>Flask</i>.  To
  install <i>Flask</i> generally on your system, give this command on
  the command prompt:</p>
<pre>       pip install flask
</pre>
<p>Note that you can also specify the <i>Flask</i> version, should you
need (you won't need this one):</p> 
<pre>       pip install flask=0.10
</pre>
<p>This should install <i>Flask</i> and everything it depends on.
Don't be surprised if you find it has installed several Python
modules as a result.</p>

<p><i>Flask</i> should now be installed!  Now, time to create our
first app.</p> 


<h3>6. The <tt>Simple.py</tt> example</h3>

Download <tt>simple.py</tt> from today's lecture notes area into a
folder of your choice.  Go to that folder using <tt>cd</tt> commands
on a Terminal window and try:
<pre>   $ python simple.py    // to run the server app (simple.py) on the server
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
</pre>
Then access it (as many times as you wish) on your web browser (e.g.,
Chrome) with: 
<pre>       http://127.0.0.1:5000/
</pre>
<p>When you are done, stop the server by hitting <b>control-C</b>.</p>



<h3>7. The Quickstart example</h3>

<p>Now go back
  to <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/</a>
  and click on <tt>Quickstart</tt> and follow the instructions on that page
  for a quick tour.  You will end up trying a command like this:</p>
<pre>       python hello.py    // to run the server app (hello.py) on the server
         * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
</pre>
Then access it (as many times as you wish) on your web browser with:
<pre>       http://127.0.0.1:5000/
</pre>
<p>When you are done, stop the server by hitting <b>control-C</b>.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>
